```How about "20/20 Reminder"? It combines the key elements of your project, which are the 20-minute intervals and the 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. Plus, "20/20" is a commonly used term to refer to perfect vision, so the name could also evoke the idea of taking a break to maintain good eye health.```

 

# **I named it OptiPause-20-20ðŸ˜‚**
